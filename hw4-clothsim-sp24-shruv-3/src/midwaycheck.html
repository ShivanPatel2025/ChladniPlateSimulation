            <h2>Project Summary</h2>
            <p>In the initial stages of our Chladni Plate Simulation project, we've successfully created a foundational framework that marries the complexities of sound wave physics with graphical rendering to visualize the fascinating phenomena of Chladni patterns. This early version of our simulation not only brings to life the dynamic formations of these patterns but also empowers users to interact with the system by adjusting sound frequencies. Through a straightforward interface, users can now witness the real-time transformation of patterns, which enhances both the educational and engagement aspects of our project. This marks a significant step forward in our aim to simulate the mesmerizing effect of sound vibrations on particulate matter.</p>

            <h2>Reflection on Progress</h2>
            <p>Reflecting on our journey thus far, our team's progress closely aligns with our planned objectives, successfully overcoming challenges that stood in our way. The major hurdle of simulating accurate wave-particle interactions—a cornerstone in creating realistic Chladni figures—was met with a robust solution that laid the groundwork for future enhancements. This achievement not only validates our approach but also sets a promising stage for refining the simulation's fidelity and user experience. As we proceed, our focus will be on leveraging this foundation to introduce more complex features and improve the overall quality of the simulation.</p>
